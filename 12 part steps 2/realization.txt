machine music 1 is composed of a concatenation of the 12 all partition arrays in this folder
Each lyne pair is realized in the same register, with the top pair being the highest register

The order of the notes within each aggregate is determined using the following, very straightforward procedure:

Start with the top row, if it contains at least one note, play the first of those and delete it.
Go to next lowest row, if it contains at least one note, play the first of those and delete it.
Keep doing this.
After the last row, go back to the first row and repeat.
After all notes of the aggregate have been deleted, go to the next aggregate and use the same procedure.

The arrays are designed such that with this realization, aggregates within lyne pairs are formed

Example:
the aggregate
54



98BA


76
03
21

would be realized as
5	4



 9        8	  BA


  7	    6
   0         3
    2          1

Rhythmically, the duration of each note is determined by a simple mapping of pc's to durations: 0 is length 1, 1 is length 2, etc

That's it!
